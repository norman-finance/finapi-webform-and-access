Please use the endpoint <a href='?product=web_form_2.0#post-/api/webForms/standingOrder' target='_blank'> here</a> to initiate (create and also submit) standing orders!<br/><br/>Submit a standing order to the bank which was previously created with the 'Create a standing order' service.<br/><br/>Before you submit the standing order, please check that the given bank interface supports the required PIS capabilities, otherwise the standing order could get rejected.<br/>In case the standing order is initiated from a given IBAN, please refer to the field BankInterface.paymentCapabilities to be sure the standing order you are creating is currently supported by the bank.<br/><br/>Usually banks require a multi-step authentication to authorize the standing order. In this case, and if the finAPI Web Form flow is not used, the service will respond with HTTP code 510 and an error object containing a multiStepAuthentication object which describes the necessary next authentication steps. You must then retry the service call, passing the same arguments plus an additional 'multiStepAuthentication' element.<br/>Please refer to the description of the HTTP 510 error code below and the documentation of the 'MultiStepAuthenticationCallback' response object for details.<br/><br/><b>ATTENTION:</b> For XS2A interface additional headers must be included in the request if the end user is involved.
